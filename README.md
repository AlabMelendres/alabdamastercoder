# alabdamastercoder

Hello!

I am a begginer coder (I can say that because I am 10 years old.) I know HTML & CSS and learning to write Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript. I made this repository hoping that GitHub can help me. Also, I love Firefox, especially Nightly. :simple_smile: I actually contribute to Mozilla. :muscle:
